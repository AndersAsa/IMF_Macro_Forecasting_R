# IMF Macroeconomic Forecasting in R

This R code is based on the IMF course [Macroeconomic Forecasting](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:IMFx+MFx+2015T3/info). The course is conducted in E-Views and this script aims to replicate the results in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Many of the results have slight discrepencies or are given using a different type of test.

If you have any suggestions or ideas please contribute! 

We hope this helps you begin to apply what you learned in E-Views in R!
